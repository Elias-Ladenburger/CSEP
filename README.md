# About

This is the working-repository for the research project that is the basis for the Master thesis of Elias Ladenburger. 

## Goal

The goal of this research project is to build a platform with which organizational leaders can be educated in matters of cybersecurity, to an extent that they carry this knowledge back into their respective organizations ("train the managers").
Hence the working title for the research project is _executive execution platform_ (EEP).

## Approach

The thesis itself follows a design science research approach as outlined by Hevner et al. (2004). The problem-definition and initial goal-setting is done in close collaboration with practitioning stakeholders, namely the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). Requirements for the end-product are collected both from the business stakeholder and an existing body of knowledge. These requirements are then iteratively and incrementally implemented, following along the lines of the spiral model as proposed by Boehm (1998), seeking continuous feedback from the business stakeholder and comparing the results against the body of knowledge. Any findings that are made along the way are then feed back into the body of knowledge.
