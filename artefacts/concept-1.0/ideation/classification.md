## Motivation

When developing the platform, a series of decisions need to be made. Such decisions can either stem the knowledge base, the environment or the design process itself. The former may appear when multiple approaches to the same problem exist, while the latter are most likely implementation details.

Where possible, these decisions have been phrased as dichotomous questions. It is our belief that such questions are most comprehensible and allow for good comparison with other scenario-platforms.

## Limitations

We are not currently aware of any taxonomy regarding scenario-based learning platforms, nor is it our goal to develop one in the course of this research project. While below questions are grounded in existing theories, they are not necessarily sufficient to describe any and all type of scenario-based platform.

## Questions

### Open or Closed 
_Open: Actions and decisions that the learner may take strongly impact how the scenario unfolds, **even if it only changes how fast the learner reaches certain milestones**._

_Closed: The actions and decisions of the learner have minor or no impact on how the scenario unfolds._

For the sake of simplicity, the prototype will only allow **closed** scenarios.

### Independent or Facilitated
_Independent: The learner uses the platform outside of a classroom setting, without supervision._

_Facilitated: The learner uses the platform under supervision of an instructor, facilitator or educator._

The AIT has previously offerend facilitated courses on cybersecurity awaress and is planning to use this platform to supplement these courses. We therefore follow a **facilitated** approach.

### Group or Individual 
_Group: Multiple learners will participate in the same instance of a scenario at the same time. Interaction between participants may or may not be necessary for advancing the scenario._

_Individual: Every learner participates in a dedicated instance of the scenario. Interaction between participants is neither possible nor required to advance the scenario._

Similarly, because the AIT has offerend group-courses, the platform will allow **groups** to participate in a scenario.

### Collaborative or Competitive
_Collaborative: Group members work together to achieve a common goal, such as by sharing information or performing complimentary actions._

_Competitive: Group members have conflicting goals and thus do not work together and may even work against each other._ 

The AIT has previously planned a setting for **collaborative** learning. This learning style has been shown to improve engagement and retention [[Dillenbourg (1999)](http://web.b.ebscohost.com.uaccess.univie.ac.at/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=f05ff426-0919-4b7b-a72b-9f3e62dec098%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=91126&db=nlebk)

### Static or Adaptive Difficulty

_Static Difficulty: The difficulty of a scenario does not change between instances and participants._

_Adaptive Difficulty: The difficulty of a scenario adapts to the participants during an instance. An example would be introducing more challenging situations when participants repeatedly take the "best" decision._

To keep the complexity of the prototype low and therefore make it easier to evaluate, it will only support **static difficulty**. The research in this field is not yet very strong and existing findings are ambiguous on the effects of adaptive difficulty [[Sampayo-Vargas et al.
