## Questions

### Open or Closed 
_Open: Actions and decisions that the learner may take strongly impact how the scenario unfolds, **even if it only changes how fast the learner reaches certain milestones**._

_Closed: The actions and decisions of the learner have minor or no impact on how the scenario unfolds._

For the sake of simplicity, the prototype will only allow **closed** scenarios.

### Independent or Facilitated
_Independent: The learner uses the platform outside of a classroom setting, without supervision._

_Facilitated: The learner uses the platform under supervision of an instructor, facilitator or educator._

The AIT has previously offerend facilitated courses on cybersecurity awaress and is planning to use this platform to supplement these courses. We therefore follow a **facilitated** approach.

### Group or Individual 
_Group: Multiple learners will participate in the same instance of a scenario at the same time. Interaction between participants may or may not be necessary for advancing the scenario._

_Individual: Every learner participates in a dedicated instance of the scenario. Interaction between participants is neither possible nor required to advance the scenario._

Similarly, because the AIT has offerend group-courses, the platform will allow **groups** to participate in a scenario.

### Collaborative or Competitive
_Collaborative: Group members work together to achieve a common goal, such as by sharing information or performing complimentary actions._

_Competitive: Group members have conflicting goals and thus do not work together and may even work against each other._ 

The AIT has previously planned a setting for **collaborative** learning. This learning style has been shown to improve engagement and retention [Dillenbourg (1999), falls Sie weitere Quellen hierzu haben, nehme ich diese gerne mit auf].

### Static or Adaptive Difficulty

_Static Difficulty: The difficulty of a scenario does not change between instances and participants._

_Adaptive Difficulty: The difficulty of a scenario adapts to the participants during an instance. An example would be introducing more challenging situations when participants repeatedly take the "best" decision._

To keep the complexity of the prototype low and therefore make it easier to evaluate, it will only support **static difficulty**. The research in this field is not yet very strong and existing findings are ambiguous on the effects of adaptive difficulty [Sampayo-Vargas et al. (2013), Vanbecelaere (2020)].
