## group personalization

While the current training mode is targeted towards a group, 
we ultimately want each individual to make an impact.
We therefore need to personalize for the group to create meaningful engagement and then further personalize for the individual to maximize learning effect.

This also allows us to accomodate for different levels of skill among the group members.
