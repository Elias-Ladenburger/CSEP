# Meeting Minutes
## Executive Summary

All stakeholders met to align on the research project for the Master's thesis of Elias Ladenburger.
Everyone is aligned that Mr. Ladenburger develops a platform for the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) which can be used to perform trainings for organizational leaders.

## Memory Protocol

### Main objectives

There are two main goals related to the cybersecurity domain:
- educate organizational leadership ("executives") on cybersecurity risks and how to deal with them ("cybersecurity awareness") and
- motivate and enable executives to spread this cybersecurity awareness within their organization ("managers as multipliers").

### Scope of the project

- Focus on developing and evaluating the platform that allows the training of executives.
    - The previous approach of also developing a cultural framework would exceed the scope of a Master's thesis.
    - Instead, the main focus of the research project will be on developing a platform, that assists in achieving the aforementioned objectives. 
    - The platform will expand upon a previously conceptualized scenario-based approach of the AIT.
    - The previous focus on "gamification" is broadened to include any type of learner-centric approach.
- The platform must be rigorously evaluated.
    - Can the platform help developing scenarios?
    - Can executives, who undergo training on this platform identify and react to cybersecurity issues?
    - Does training with the platform support executives become role-models for cybersecurity awareness?

### Ad hoc requirements to the platform

- The platform should help improve the situational awareness and problem awareness of the training participants.
- The platform must allow the creation of scenarios, such as through some sort of admin-interface.
- The platform must facilitate cooperative learning, such as allowing a group to simultaneously take the same decisions within a scenario.
- It should be possible to adjust the trainings to the target audience, specifically considering:
    - the industry of the participant's organization,
    - the position of each participant within the organization's hierarchy and
    - the existing knowledge of the participants.
    
    
### Further Remarks

- Keywords to research:
    - management principles,
    - scenario-based learning,
    - case-based learning,
    - experiential learning and
    - problem-based learning.
