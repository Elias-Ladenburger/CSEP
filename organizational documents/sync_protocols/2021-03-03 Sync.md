# Meeting Minutes
## Executive Summary
The exposé was accepted, pending minor changes. The proposal for the research project will now be sent out.

## Feedback to the exposé
- Minor spelling and wording issues:
    - be consistent in the use of 'thesis' instead of 'paper'
    - rename 'Related Works' to 'Related Work'
    - be consistent in capital-case spelling of names and chapter titles (e.g. 'hevner')
    - rename 'cybersecurity resilience' to 'cybersecurity awareness, understanding and knowing how to react'
- Motivation is adequate
- Related Work:
    - sufficient, no need to describe every existing learning approach in-depth
    - gamification does not only improve learning, but also yields feedback as a form of action research
        - double learning loop
        - theoretical grounding (trevor wood-harper: action research)
- Methodical Approach
    - adequate
    - Evaluation: 'let the participants play and observe what happens'
    - use a combination of qualiative and quantitative methods
    - theoretical grounding for empirical evaluation: Kreyszig ([1979](https://www.amazon.de/Statistische-Methoden-Anwendungen-Erwin-Kreyszig/dp/3525407173)): Statistische Methoden und ihre Anwendungen
- Structure: rename slightly
    - Rename Chapter 4 to 'Model'
    - Rename Chapter 5 to 'Prototype'
    - Rename Chapter 6 to 'Discussion'
    - Rename Chapter 7 to 'Conclusion'
- Schedule:
    - Change the entry for June / July to finalize & test prototype
- New working title:
    - Development of a platform for cybersecurity awareness education
