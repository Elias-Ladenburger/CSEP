# Meeting Minutes

## Executive Summary

## Open Questions

Regarding scenarios
* Is it possible to see / participate in a scenario as currently conducted by the AIT?
* Does the AIT currently assess characteristics of the learners?
    * capability / previous experience
    * industry
    * position within organization
* Are scenarios adapted to learner skills?
* Is there a glossary / dictionary for terms used by AIT?
* Are scenarios tailored to the characteristics of the learners? How?
* Are there sample scenarios that can be used for the Master thesis?
* Is there a process / guideline on how to create new scenarios?
* What (else) does a scenario need? Resources? Items? Locations? Variables?
* Are there any statistics captured on scenario-usage already? What kind?

Regarding other topics:
* is there a source on what a "leadership principle" is (it seems a widespread term - has it really originated from Fayol)?
* is there a source that explains how to define a target group?
(we previously said _position_, _industry_ and _experience_ - is this MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)?)
