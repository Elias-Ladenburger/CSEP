Regarding the scenario design:
* how long does a scenario usually last?
  * answer time of aout 2-5 mins => ca 2h

    * üblicherweise nur einen Trainer, 
* are there any observers?
* Current status 
  * linear scenario with statistical questions
  * Different roles among participants
  * observer-role can be covered
  * trainer role can be covered
  * participant role is covered
* Which features exactly are missing from Menti?
  * branching scenarios and variables were not intended so far
  * Usage statistics?
  * Quizzes? (I think I saw one such question in the example)
* How often is such as scenario reused 
  * with the same group?
