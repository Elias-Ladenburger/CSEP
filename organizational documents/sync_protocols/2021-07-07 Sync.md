# Meeting Minutes

## Open Questions

Testing:
* Sources for evaluation (Venable, Pris-Heje & Baskerville; Sonnenberg & vom Brocke)


## Summary of discussed topics


### Concept
* Checking the ubiquitous language (definitions of key concepts)
    * Provide literature references
    * Conditions: provide reasoning for choice of conditions, especially NAND (not and) operator
    * clearly define story (usually "story" and "episode" are differentiated)
* Technology Decisions:
    * Provide reasoning for technology stack in main body of thesis
    * Detailed explanation in appendix
* Discussing current status of the class diagram of injects and scenarios
    * layers: what else might be placed in "infrastructure" layer?
    * Explain how different packages are coupled with each other
* Discussing the multiview approach (static view, dynamic view, requirements view & participant, trainer, scenario designer)
    * makes sense

### Implementation
* How do the different classes interact with each other?
    * Message Bus?
    * Shared Infrastructure?
* "Required Knowledge" is didactical: must be obvious from the inject
* Hints will never be perfect
* reference original source of Petri Nets


### Evaluation
* Evaluation approach:
    * Should be aligned with AIT - Dr. Leitner already has ideas
    * Overall:
        * Interpretavism - researcher still interprets the results
        * Pragmatism - researcher uses different methods for evaluation
    * Process:
        * literature review
    * Product
        * expert-walkthrough
        * focus group
        * participant observation
